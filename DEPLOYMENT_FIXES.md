# Deployment Fixes for Streamlit Cloud

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Requirements.txt Optimization
- **Problem**: Some ML libraries (LightGBM, CatBoost) were causing installation issues on Streamlit Cloud
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `lightgbm` and `catboost` from requirements.txt
  - Used specific version numbers instead of minimum versions for better compatibility
  - Updated to stable versions known to work on Streamlit Cloud

### 2. Code Dependencies
- **Problem**: `deploy_app.py` was importing problematic libraries
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `import lightgbm as lgb`
  - Removed `from catboost import CatBoostRegressor, CatBoostClassifier`
  - Removed LightGBM and CatBoost from model options
  - Updated hyperparameter handling for XGBoost only

### 3. Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Invalid Streamlit configuration option causing warnings
- **Solution**: Removed `navigationMode = "expanded"` from `.streamlit/config.toml`

## Current Deployment Files

### Main Files for Deployment:
1. **`deploy_app.py`** - Main application file (use this for deployment)
2. **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
3. **`packages.txt`** - System dependencies
4. **`.streamlit/config.toml`** - Streamlit configuration
5. **`setup.sh`** - Setup script for deployment

### Available Models:
**Classification:**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Naive Bayes

**Regression:**
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**: Make sure all files are committed to your repository
2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set the main file path to: `deploy_app.py`
   - Deploy

## Testing Locally

To test the deployment version locally:
```bash
streamlit run deploy_app.py
```

## Notes

- The application now uses only stable, well-supported libraries
- All core ML functionality is preserved
- Google Colab integration is still available
- Navigation and UI improvements are maintained
- The application should deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud
